# Privacy Policy – Crypter (Demo)

**Effective date:** 10 Oct 2025

Crypter (Demo) is an offline password vault focused on local storage and no cloud sync.

## Data we process

- **On-device only:** Titles, usernames/emails, passwords, optional website, and app settings are stored **locally** on your device.
- **No developer collection:** We do not collect or transmit your vault data to our servers (we operate no backend for Crypter Demo).

## Third-party services

- **Password generator:** PasswordWolf API (HTTPS). Random password only; no personal data sent.
- **Email breach check (optional):** XposedOrNot API (HTTPS). The email you enter is sent to that service **only when you tap the check**.

## Data sharing

- We do **not** share your data with third parties except when you explicitly use the breach-check feature, which sends your email to the third-party API as part of the requested functionality.

## Storage & security (Demo)

- In this demo build, entries are stored **in plaintext** via AsyncStorage.
- **Do not** use this demo for real production credentials.
- A future release plans on-device encryption (AES-GCM with SecureStore keys) and biometrics.

## Your choices

- **Export / Delete:** Use _Settings → Export data_ or _Clear all data_.
- Uninstalling the app removes local data from your device.

## Children’s privacy

- Not directed to children. Do not use if you are under the legal age in your jurisdiction without guardian consent.

## Changes

We may update this policy. The “Effective date” will be revised accordingly.
